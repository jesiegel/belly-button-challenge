# belly-button-challenge

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dashboards includes a bar chart and bubble chart. There is also a demographic infor section which shows the specific information for each test subject. You can look at different test subjects by using the dropdown menu and selecting a different ID. The dropdown menu also changes updates the bar and bubble chart accordingly.
